# 🧠 Linear Regression & Neural Network Classifier on Pokémon Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies both linear regression and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to a classification problem using Pokémon statistics. The goal is to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary based on its attributes.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a basic linear regression model for binary classification.
- Develop a custom multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch.
- Tune hyperparameters of the neural network (e.g., learning rate, number of hidden units) for optimal performance.
- Compare model accuracy and analyze results.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

- **pokemon_data.csv**: Dataset containing various statistics about Pokémon (e.g., HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.)
- **Target Variable:** Legendary status (binary)

## 📈 Results

- Built and evaluated linear regression and MLP models for classification.
- Improved classification performance through hyperparameter tuning of the MLP.
- Demonstrated tradeoffs between model complexity and performance.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Developed a foundational understanding of neural networks and backpropagation.
- Practiced model implementation without external libraries.
- Learned how hyperparameters impact model training and accuracy.
